## Introduction to Grafana

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.

## Docker Compose Configuration

This Docker Compose setup deploys Grafana in a Docker container, providing a powerful and flexible way to visualize and analyze your data.

## Docker Compose File (docker-compose.yml)

```
version: "3.8"
services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    container_name: grafana
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
     - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana
volumes:
  grafana-storage: {}
```

## Key Components of the Configuration

Service:Grafana


* Image: grafana/grafana is the Docker image used for Grafana.
* Ports:
    3000:3000 maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container, where Grafana's web interface is accessible.
* Volumes:
    grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana provides persistent storage for Grafana's data.
* Restart Policy: unless-stopped ensures that the Grafana service restarts automatically unless explicitly stopped.

## Deployiing Grafana


1. Save the Docker Compose configuration in a docker-compose.yml file.
2. Run docker-compose up -d to start Grafana in detached mode.
3. Access Grafana by navigating to http://<host-ip>:3000.

## Configuring and Using Grafana

After deployment, configure Grafana through its web interface to connect to your data sources, create dashboards, and set up alerts.
